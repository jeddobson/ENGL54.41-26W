THE PAVING QUARRY
Our pathway led through birches shoulder-high;
It was autumn, and the little yellow leaves,
So slender were their stems, seemed poised in air,
And gaily did they flutter in the wind.
The huckleberry leaves shone brilliant red,
And bayberry scattered incense on our way,
As now we walked through plots of velvet moss,
And now on granite ledges gray and hard.
Our journey came abruptly to a stop,
And there in ragged grayness lay the quarry.
"This pavin' motion," my companion said,
"Was goin' to make me rich, and made me poor.
'Twas in the eighties I began work here,
When all great cities paved their streets with blocks.
A nickel apiece they were, and I could reel
Two hundred blocks or more each blessed day.
The reelin' wa'n't much like the reelin' now:
'Most anything would do. Along this hump
Were fifty motions clickin' every day.
3


## p. 4 (#18) ###############################################

THE PAVING QUARRY
Beside that barrel there filled up with chips
I reeled, the happiest hours of my life,
I wouldn't say how many thousand blocks,
While Fred, my butty, plug-drilled and broke stone.
I somehow liked the music of the sound,
The click-clack-clickin' of a hundred drills
From all these motions in among the trees.
How different now, when all you ever hear
Is chickadees, or crickets, or the frogs!
I sometimes think they liked the noises, too,
Of hammers clickin', and the rattlin' wheels
Of wagons, or the creakin' of the hames
In horses' collars on these rocky roads.
For we were prosp'rous then; at half-past four
'Most any night but Friday you could smell
Beefsteak a-fryin' anywhere in town,
And hear the snap and sizzle in the spider.
(We can't afford to eat beefsteak to-day.)
'Twas fun at night to see the youngsters bolt
To meet their daddies, grab the dinner pail,
And find a cookie or a piece of cake
Left there like toll-bait to be sure they came.
'Twas fun just after supper to drop 'round
To Em❜ry's store, and hear the boys run on.

## p. 5 (#19) ###############################################

THE PAVING QUARRY
They'd smoke, and fight John L.'s big mills again,
With Paddy Ryan, Mitchell, Jake Kilrain—
They never loved another like John L.
And sometimes, when the bottle went around,
The boys would sing. I wish you could 'a' heard
Mike Flemin' sing "The Wind that Blew Across
The Wild Moor'; somethin' in his Irish voice
Would make you think o' lonely winds at night,
And cryin' children strayin' on the moor.
And then on Saturdays we'd have a dance,
And start it with a break-down in the store.
I always liked the break-down best; the boys
Were keyed just right, the jew's-harp twanged and
twanged,
The harmonica began with 'Home Sweet Home,'
And Cowin', wounded at Bull Run, would clog,
And dance the 'Buck and Wing' in perfect time.
Then all would leave to join the 'March and Circle'
Except the old men who would set and smoke.
Ah, them were jolly days; I never thought
They'd leave us as they did; the price went down,
And cities paved with asphalt room o' blocks;
The young folks moved away, but we were old,
Too old to think of other towns as home-
5


## p. 6 (#20) ###############################################

THE PAVING QUARRY
For home is where you bring your children up;
And there we were without a place to farm,
Who might 'a' had ten acres turned to field.
Perhaps it's just as well. A hundred hens,
A little garden truck, a chance to fish,
And time to talk of pranks we did as boys
One way of life's as good's another, I guess,
If we just take it right—that's all that counts."
He gazed along the west; the golden sun
Was streaming through a clump of tall spruce trees.
The dead, low limbs, transfigured in the light,
Had brought the sunset near; the background stood
In lemon-colored glory; back we turned
Without a word, and down a birch-fringed path
We found the road that led our footsteps home.

OLAF
From Sweden forty years ago he came
And settled in our village on the coast
And cast his lot as one of us-a man
Who loved the sea as those alone can love her
Whose childhood longings have been stirred to life
In words made music by her mighty voice,
Engraving records on the soul of youth.
I never knew a man who loved the sea
As Olaf loved her; seasons out of mind
In boyhood days have I beheld him loaf
The morning through, beside a shelving rock
In a little yellow dory, his right hand
Aclasp two eight-foot oars, a black clay pipe
Between his teeth; loaf long and long, and watch
The dark brown rockweed rise and fall, and rise,
With motion not quite regular; watch, too,
The smoky-colored periwinkles cling,
Or zigzag through the green two fathoms down
And nestle on the bottom strewn with kelp,

OLAF
And soggy wood, and star-fish pink and white;
Or take a listening mood and hold his breath
To hear the barnacles along the rocks
Disturb the silence of that quiet cove
With little seething, whispering monotones
That are, to stormy poundings of the bay,
As chirrupings of song birds in the trees
To midnight forests crashing loud with storm.
I heeded in his steady eyes of gray
A glassy token which the old gray mother,
To mark him for her own, had spread about
His seaward-gazing countenance—a look
Found nowhere but in men who breast strong tides.
He seemed as much a part of that small cove
As did the crying sea gulls on the bar.
He drifted at the ebbing of each tide
Out over eel-grass to his cherished weir,
Between the island and the harbor's mouth,
And climbed the stakes to look for schools of herring.
For twenty years expectantly he pulled
His wherry to the weir and back again;
For twenty years he thought about the tides
And dreamed about the mystery of skies;
8


## p. 9 (#23) ###############################################

OLAF
And sunsets played around his wrinkled cheeks
And lit them as they lit the rolling calm
Of waters stretching out to evening sea.
His first score years with us he was content
To tend his lobster pots; but when he saw
His neighbors building weirs and growing rich
(A man who saves ten thousand we call rich),
He plunged with high adventure like the others,
Sold out his traps, and launched his life anew.
He paid a motley group of men, and worked
On pocket, pound, and leader, day and night,
Spending the harvest garnered through hard years
Of labor in our newer, freer land,
Borne up by dream-propped, cedar stakes of hope.
Strong tides flowed in as only tides of spring
In that bleak northern land can flow: they rise
Full sixteen feet above low water-mark,
Overflood the wharfs, and loosen old dried rockweed,
Stuck through with sticks, tossed up a year before.
They set adrift old fishing barrels, tarred
To keep them water tight, and slabs of spruce
Thrown up by woman's hand for winter's fire;
9


## p. 10 (#24) ##############################################

OLAF
And when all these come drifting with the tide
At twelve o'clock, their weird and motley shapes
So variegate the surface of the bight
That one imagines gorgeous treasure chests
Afloat from some old pirate ship of Spain,
Or fabulous ambergris, near which there lurks
A sea-serpent cavorting on the waters;
And scores of other monsters dotted round
The sun-bedazzled surface of the sea.
But these tides came and went with never a catch
For Olaf in his fortune-tempting weir.
And more spring tides swept by, and, year by year,
They brought him only deeper poverty.
At times he wished he never had forgone
The steady work of lobstering, and plunged
The savings of his youth adventurously;
At times he vowed he never would rebuild
The weir another spring.
Then spring would come,
And with it come new hopes and new desires.
10


## p. 11 (#25) ##############################################

OLAF
And always in the fancies of his mind,
Awakened by the fragrances of spring,
He saw a thousand shining bushels swim,
And show their cool green backs in darting schools,
Huge smacks impatient for the ebbing tide,
And seining time an hour of pure delight,
With herring boiling in the pound so thick
The purse-strings could not be drawn tight beneath
Until a dory load or two were dipped
To keep the bulging twine from bursting through.
With this he drove new stakes and cut new brush,
Repaired the breaches winter ice had made,
Stretched out his leaders to the harbor's mouth,
Put twine around his pocket, tarred his seine;
And as he smelled the pungent, boiling tar,
He dreamed his April dreams of wealth and ease.
He smiled upon his work indulgently;
For what is fairer on a cool, spring dusk,
When calmness overbroods the friendly cove,
Than what he now beholds with leaping blood
Flowing as freely as a channel tide:
The perfect pattern of a herring weir-
11


## p. 12 (#26) ##############################################

OLAF
Two magic circles touched by two long lines,
Distinct as white birch in a clump of spruce,
Harmonious lines, and glimmering colored lights,
Amid the silver grays of high-tide rocks,
And breasts dark brown of island shores laid bare,
Whose fluttering pulses call the evening star
To hasten from southeastern corridors,
And crown the weir's round grace with one more charm?
But spring would pass, and long bright summer days
With southwest breezes every afternoon
For weeks together follow; yet, to him
The tides brought only added store of dream.
And so he lingers in his little skiff
While each succeeding moon beguiles the tides,
And scans each change the setting sun displays
While gliding down behind the darkening trees,
Tinting his herring weir with stainless gold.

GEORGE MCGOON
Slim George McGoon on Sunday night
Had just one answer, "That's a' right,”
To every questioning of mine
When I was but a child of nine,
And he was on his weekly bout
With Scotch, his lotus flower for doubt.
He staggered from the barn or shed,
Whose stanchions flocked about his head,
Past cluttered pick-axes and hoes,
And other obstacles that rose
To make his progress one long maze
Of fresh adventures lost in haze.
My mother often took the key
And went away forgetting me
13


## p. 14 (#28) ##############################################

GEORGE MC GOON
Out playing in his yard next door
With pups or kittens, half a score,
Where tiredness waylaid my eyes,
Taking its toll of childhood cries,
Till he would come and hold me tight
In his rough arms, with, "That's a' right.'
Once when my sister tore her dress
And no help came from my caress,
"
He stumbled out to soothe her plight
With "That's a' right, child, that's a' right.”
II
On week days with his dinner pail,
Or coming from the evening mail
In summer, twilight would intrude
His spirit's dusty solitude:
The beams would dance in yellow rays
And draw from George another phrase
14


## p. 15 (#29) ##############################################

GEORGE MC GOON
Whose words, impressive, soft and slow,
Were, "I don't know; well, I don't know."
I've seen his eyes grow dappled gray
Upon a stirring stormy day;
Or when a neighbor had been laid
Away beneath the poplar shade,
And thoughts of soul-life after death
Were holding everybody's breath;
Down through the pasture woods he'd go
With, "I don't know; well, I don't know."
The mellow Sunday mood was best
For his thin vein of sharp unrest,
For all his choicest blessings then
Were lavished on the sons of men,-
Relieving the agnostic mood
That tortured him in sober blood.
And thus his life, through shine and snow,
Was, "That's a' right," and "I don't know."

MAIL TIME
The full moon staggers from the quivering sea,
Turning to glistening white the snow-thatched roofs,
And silhouetting limbs of maple trees
Against the moon-white homes and big red barns
That catch the wind's moan in the dead of winter.
The crisp clear spirit of the night calls forth
Hallos that echo through bare pasture woods,
And stillness holds the flushed pearl-handled shoreline
Securely on the knife-blade of the tide.
Faint sleigh bells ring far up the winding roadway,
And speed the lagging pulse-beat of the village.
The crunching snow beneath expectant feet,
The clear, sharp bells of neatly painted sleighs,
One with a lover and his smiling sweetheart,-
The opening and closing of shed doors,
The dull, slow cow-bell on a farmer's woodsled,
The steady click of oars in distant rowlocks,
Proclaim to every one, "The mail has come;'
And in the post-office the people gather
""
16


## p. 17 (#31) ##############################################

MAIL TIME
So thickly that the carrier with mail-bags—
A lame, grease-spotted, walrus-whiskered veteran-
Must wriggle like a skilful football player
To break his way through groups of waiting neighbors.
Before the numbered boxes in the corner
The little girls, in faded woolen dresses
And tightly braided pigtails tied with twine,
On tiptoe stare excitedly for tidings
Of brothers over-seas or out West ranching,
Or brothers office-bound in busy cities.
The bigger girls distribute knowing glances
From eyes that flash the code of silent comment,
Whenever Frone, the postmistress, stops pounding
Ker-stamp, ker-stamp, ker-stamp, on fifty letters,
And takes time out to read a scrawling postal.
The old men in a circle round the fire
Dig out and fill their pipes as they spoon out
And tamp a lewis hole in ash-gray quarries.
They talk about the weather and deplore
The backing of the wind, and prophesy
A heavy snow storm, if the changing moon
Does not bestir herself to stave it off.
17


## p. 18 (#32) ##############################################

MAIL TIME
The three survivors of the Civil War:
(Stout Eben, with his right forefinger curled
Around his T. D. stem-he lifts it high
Whenever he removes it for a speech;-
Old Tower, with his long, white-flowing beard
Just reaching to his lap when he leans forward
To praise the strategy of George McClellan;
And Jonathan, lean boyhood friend of Eben,
Nicknamed "By Joe," to fit his favorite oath,-)
Retell the dashing stories of Bull Run
And Fredericksburg: and Eben always adds
The playing of the band across the river
That night at Fredericksburg: his hair stood up
To hear the band play Dixie, and deep shame
Rushed over him that he should like it more
Than his, replying bravely with John Brown.
The flutter of the youngsters at the mail
Perturbs these patriarchs little, for their day
Of getting letters vanished long ago
Beyond the woods of age, too bare of leaves
To catch the afterglow and bring it back.
"The mail is open," pipes the Ever Faithful,
And one by one, according to their natures,
18


## p. 19 (#33) ##############################################

MAIL TIME
Alive with hope, they face the small square window.
The village belle takes up a clean white letter
And smiles her swift way out, while others watch her.
The frozen earth, to her, becomes a carpet
Of gorgeous tapestry on which she floats
Through some white Oriental crystal palace,
Where hidden orchestras near marble fountains
Play bits like "Silver Threads Among the Gold.”
A shy-faced boy, with mystical detachment
Apparent in his eyes and on his mouth,
With dreamy otherworldness in his walk,
And head just slightly tilted to one side,
Takes tremblingly his twice rejected poem
That vaguely phrases dim, aspiring visions.
The drawn, pale man, with stone-cutter's consumption,
Recoils with fear to see a lawyer's letter,
And slinks away without a word of greeting.
The cocksure dude, expecting special matter,
Rejects the shaking of Aunt Fronie's head,
Insisting he has something in the mail,
At which an altercation soon brings out
19


## p. 20 (#34) ##############################################

MAIL TIME
Aunt Fronie's rapier gift of shining speech
Whose cutting epithets thrust in and twist,
Driving the youth for refuge to the sidewalk.
The village wag sends home a bunch of postals
From Boston to his friends: "Wish you was here."
"Played checkers with the Iron Man last night
At Austin Stone's Museum. Did he beat me?
Well I should say so; take him on yourself once."
"Having a swell time. Went out to Harvard College,
And seen the flowers at the Agassiz,
That beat the posies in Aunt Cal's front yard."
The crowd thins out. The old men take their papers
And face again the clear December night.
A slamming door far down the village street
Tells loudly some one's disappointed heart.
The merrily jingling bells of sleighs that carry
Well wrapped up lovers, ring melodious mockery
To Jeremiahs preaching staves of doom.
The dull, slow cow-bell on the farmer's woodsled
Tells neither joy nor sorrow, for the men
Who ride it have turned in the quiet wood-road
Leading along earth's still, gray neutral slopes.
20


## p. 21 (#35) ##############################################

MAIL TIME
I listen for the oars in distant rowlocks,
And only hear the far off moaning rote
Of ocean on the ledges in the harbor;
At nine the village lights are out, and all
The beauty of the town beneath the stars
Is wrapped once more in silence as the last
Faint tinkle of the mail team dies away.
21

CYRUS
The evening Asbury died I went to watch
Beside his coffin through the long, still night,
A mellow winter's night of melting snow;
And as I neared the house I felt the spell
That always filled our village when the dead
Were lingering among us in deep silence.
I turned the door-knob softly and stepped in
To find the table spread, the coffee pot
Beside the stovepipe on the kitchen stove,
Just warm and spurting forth a steamy fragrance.
The parlor hanging lamp, not often lit,
Shed ruddy light that foiled the household gloom
And reached the "Angelus," the "Hope," the "Glean-
ers,"
Contending with the chromos on the walls.
Three neighbors greeted me in friendly tones:
The first was Tom McKellar, village blacksmith,
Who read the Bible constantly and loved
22


## p. 23 (#37) ##############################################

CYRUS
To argue on its mysteries with the doctor
And other unbelievers in the town;
The second, Adam Kirk, a lanky Scot,
With mind as free as Tom's was Bible-bound,
Broke every Sabbath in a long hard tramp
Through deep spruce woods, or sat by smelting brooks,
Emerging fresh to spend another week
On hard gray ashler in the barren stonesheds.
The third and last among the watchers, Cyrus,
Of massive frame and calm, hypnotic face,
With dappled freckles in his big gray eyes,
Stretched out full length upon a haircloth lounge
To ease the pain a wooden leg was kindling.
His voice held overtones from out of doors
Which stirred in me desire to learn the secret
That fashioned him a stout New England oak,-—
An oak whose glittering top ensnared the sunshine,
Whose base was rooted in the unchanging hills.
Without a sentence, Cyrus took a lamp,
And led us to the chill, damp sitting-room,
Across whose corner Asbury lay at peace
In a long black casket trimmed with silver handles.
An evening wind just stirring as we entered
23


## p. 24 (#38) ##############################################

CYRUS
Swayed the green curtain of a lifted window,
Making a ghostly awe come down upon us
That hushed our voices to a reverent whisper.
We looked in ev'ry hour until twelve,
And passed the interims in random talk,-
Now calling up details of Asbury's life,
Now mulling over matters in the village.
From time to time a neighbor happened in
To volunteer his service as a watch,
But, finding four of us already there,
Invariably would put his lantern down,
Light up his pipe, then say "Good night,” and leave us.
At twelve we sat around the kitchen table
And talked until the barriers of day
Were down, and man to man we found us able
To stroll into each other's pastures, lingering
In genuine communion such as happens
But once or twice in any human lifetime.
The talk quite simply turned to unseen forces
Beyond the world of matter: Tom protesting
That simple Bible faith was all sufficient
To forge man's metal for the flint of death.
24


## p. 25 (#39) ##############################################

CYRUS
The Scot reiterated his release
From creeds and dogma, praising Ingersoll
And poohing tales of Spiritland as traps
Rigged up to frighten children, catch old women,
And snare red-blooded workmen up like rabbits.
Expectantly we turned to look at Cyrus.
He took his wooden leg off, placed it under
The lounge, where it would not be gazing at us,
And hesitated long before he spoke.
"I used to think as you do, Adam, once,
But since this leg was shot off I feel different.
And now I'll tell you things I almost never
Say a word about. The night before
My accident we all were goin' gunnin';
A raft of birds was feedin' round "The Stallion,'
And 'Two Bush Reef' and "The Roarin' Bull' were
black
With scads of coots, and low tide served at sunrise.
I reeved my tollers, cleaned my shootin' iron,
And went to bed round eight o'clock, I s'pose;
At midnight I woke up, and all was silent,
Till father's clock, that hadn't struck for ten years,
25


## p. 26 (#40) ##############################################

CYRUS
Up and struck one as plain as I am speakin'.
I soon dozed off to sleep and had a nightmare,
Dreamin' the air was full of little shot,
Jest bird shot, number eight or nine, I guess,
And I was breathin' 'em in throat and lungs.
They tore my chest and racked me all to pieces,
Till I woke up a lump of foggy sweat,
Resolvin' then and there that I wa'n't goin'
To hunt for coots, no matter what the day was.
I woke up Em❜ly and told what happened,
And she allowed that I had had a warnin'
And shouldn't go. Next mornin' long 'fore sun-up,
The boys come over yellin' 'Cyrus!' 'Cyrus!'
And I went down and told 'em I wa'n't goin'.
They asked the reason why; I wouldn't answer.
They teased and plagued me till I up and told 'em,
And they yelled 'Booger Man,' and 'Ho! Ho! Ho!'
Till I was plumb ashamed, went back upstairs,
Hauled on my pants and said, 'Don't make a touse, boys,
And I'll be comin' with you,' for that minute
I'd 'a' faced Old Nick himself and never flinched.
It was a Jim-dandy mornin' to go gunnin',-
The grass was brittle and the medder frozen
26


## p. 27 (#41) ##############################################

CYRUS
With thin shell ice that covered all the puddles;
And when the sun come up I thought how silly
I was to give away to dreams and warnin's;
But I had not been in the boat an hour
Before I saw a loon come up ahead
Not fifty yards, I reached and grabbed the muzzle
Of my old Parker layin' there half cocked
And pulled her toward me.
hammer
Somethin' caught the
And off she went-my leg and half the 'gunnel'
Of my new skiff was blowed to smithereens;
And from that day to this when I've had warnin's,
Without a word I've jest obeyed their whispers.
A dozen times present'ments came out true.
The night the Portland went down I was goin'
To row to Big Green Island; ducks and drakes
Had struck in round the ledges by the thousands.
(This leg off didn't cure me none of huntin':
I'm old, but when I hear the rabbit hounds
Go yelpin' in the alders in December,
They make what my ear calls a sweeter music
Than all the opery from here to Paris;
And ole-squaws' ah-ah-link around the kelp rocks
27


## p. 28 (#42) ##############################################

CYRUS
Are worse than rabbit hounds to get my blood up.)
But's I was sayin', when the Portland went down,
The calmest afternoon I ever see,
A voice behind me spoke up, 'Don't go, Cyrus';
I looked around, for I was puttin' tollers
Ship-shape in my green skiff, and not a sound
For rods, except the wash along the beach,
And not a soul in sight could I see stirrin'.
I didn't feel right, walked up Jackson's field,
And's I was comin' through the cat-o'-nine tails
Beside the old deserted pavin' motion,
I heard that voice behind me, 'Don't go, Cyrus,'
And I hauled up my boat.
A big no'theaster,
The biggest here for more than sixty winters,
Come down that night and blowed great guns till
mornin'.
From my back door next day, when the mist scaled up,
Five sailin' wrecks were plain in sight, and one,
A lumber-johnny, had five strappin' men
Stiff frozen in the riggin' when we reached her.
Four hundred people went down on the Portland,
And not a soul was left to tell the tale.

CYRUS
When I went over to the Head next mornin'
Dead birds were piled in windrows by the lighthouse,—
I tell you ropes and anchors counted little
When that storm got to traipsin' down the coast;
If it had struck me in my little wherry,
I wouldn't be here now, and you all know it.
I guess they's things beyond the things we know;
And if we jest took time to work 'em up
As men work up a lather when they're shavin',
We'd know much more about it than we do.
They may be souls of dead folks, curious like,
A visitin' old friends, or p'r'aps they are
The bashful ones who hate to leave the earth
Like folks we know who never leave the town
Where they were raised—and I incline to that;
They tended children when we went away,
And now I think they're takin' care of us."
He roused himself as if he had forgot
To do his duty by the darkened room,
Put on his wooden leg in solemn silence,
Apologized for talking of himself,
Knocked out the ashes from his pipe and took

Intruding, brought us back from that dim world
The speech of Cyrus had us living in.

THE CASE OF AUNT CAL
Neat Aunt Cal was tall and lean,
With nose like the snout on a soup-tureen,
Specs that slid south when she wanted to look mean,
And dirt on her brain black as bombazine.
Her one grand passion was trying to keep clean:
The cobwebs vanished from her square demesne
Like a squad caught napping by a Lewis machine.
No dust on her cupboards was ever seen
In the kitchen, or the buttery; no college dean
Ever ruled his gang with a sterner mien
Than Cal as she wrought each day's routine.
Her lobster-catcher husband, poor meaching Gene,
Took his sea boots off in the barn; he was green
As the bay on which he was wont to careen
His little green wherry when the fresh sardine
Served as bait in his pots on the bay's terrene.

THE CASE OF AUNT CAL
He puffed his corn-cob with a calm demean,
But never in the house, where nicotine
Was no more welcome than Nik Lenine
At a Rotary dinner on the mezzanine.
One day when a storm blew fresh and keen,
And Cal as crisp as crinoline
With a worn stub broom had seventeen
Times swept the path on her daily preen,
She looked up quickly, and O the scene
That struck her eyes! there lay poor Gene
On a shutter with seaweed wound thirteen
Uncanny times around him. A story book queen
Would have swooned away, but Cal had been
To a sterner school, and could intervene
To hold up the passage of the palanquin.
The four strong men, with cords shagreen
Standing out on their necks, strode in between
Two big porch pillars toward the spick cuisine,
While the bubbles were dripping from their oil-skins'
sheen.
One glance, and a shudder shook Cal's spleen,
And with eyes like a wounded wolverine,

A LOBSTER CATCHER
At birth he heard the dauntless, sounding sea;
And when his eyes first left his mother's breast
And ventured to look through the cottage window,
He heyed aloud to see the tumbling foam,
And white gulls skimming out among the ledges.
As soon as he could walk he played around
Old fishing barrels on the beach, and ran
To help his father haul the wherry up,
Or toy with tangled rope and potheads thrown
In heaps beside the fish-house. How he loved
The pungency of tar, the smell of laths,
The fragrant pitch of spruce boughs bundled up
For arching pot-limbs! How he loved the sand
That filtered in between his toes, ticklish
And warm beneath the glaring sun! The blue
And dainty pearl of sand-swept mussel shells
The egg-like smoothness of round poppel stones
Rolling and rattling up and down the beach,
The wild sweet peas that bordered headland rocks,

Instilled in him the mood that shaped his mind
And made him what he was a wistful, shy,
Tide-swept, and salty nursling of the sea.
At ten he craved to swim and scamper out
With other boys before the tide had wound
Its sinuous way over the shining flats.
Together they would strip and race about
In soft blue mud, beset with honey pots,
That spattered over their burning backs and arms,
And seek amid the eel-grass for the holes
Where lobsters came to shed in late July.
The tide rushed tousling in; they dived and swam,
And raced along the beach like savages,
Filling the woods with pagan shouts of joy
Until the ebb tide chilled the shallow cove,
And chilled their rigid faces blue as whetstones.
When maple leaves defied the year's old age
By dressing up in glorious crimson gowns,
He hunted hooks and sinkers in the barn,
Cut slender smelt poles, dug for angle worms,
And found a small grape-basket in the cellar
To hold his catch.
With two unfailing pals

He took his muddy stand at half flood tide
Where branches leaned far out above the cove,
And waited patiently the telltale nibbles.
A cork goes sidelong out, then under water,
And one of them lifts his pole up, bringing in
A sun-containing, wriggling, savory smelt.
The unaccustomed silence of the boys,
The quiet upward flowing of the tide,
Now broken only by the dying flop
Of fish within the basket struggling free,
Imbued his smelting hours with a tone
As mellow as a tanager's soft flight,
That never roughened till the lines were wound,
And, gaily chattering, all ran up to spread
Their various catches proudly out before
Unquiet mothers waiting their return.
At fifteen years he bought his first small boat,
And rigged her up with leg-o'-mutton sail
And center-board to beat against the wind.
Over the dancing waves he spanked along,
Singing rough chanteys to the singing breeze
Whose bracing, salty flavor tanned his face
A shade as brown as cliffs along the coast.

A school girl dancing gleefully about
Upon the wharf beheld his dancing eyes,
And wove a net of joy around his heart
That wrapped him as a fine-mesh seine enwraps
A school of herring when the purse-strings pinch.
With her his herring net of happiness
Was full to overflowing; and, as bloaters
Leap and sparkle brightly in the sunlight
Sending a a thrill among the eager fishermen
Whenever a seine is bulging in the weir,
So this youth-brimming pair flamed shafts of light
From eyes unjaded, when the yellow dory
Of love had windingly transported them
Within the tree-calmed, rock-walled, magic bights
Whose surface holds the deep blue of the sky,
And turns to gold and lapis lazuli
When sunset's orange-blossoms filter through.
At twenty, locked in happy marriage ties,
They built a cottage on a rocky point
Not more than fifty feet from full high tide.

To read "East Lynne" or "Dora Thorne," or talk
Of homely nothings while he set his traps

To catch the cunners for his lobster pots.
The "ghunk-hole" where they fished was shelved about
On three sides with high cliffs and ocean boulders,—
Great savage women standing in the sea
Around whose loins the rockweed draped itself
Like skirts of Hoola girls in Honolulu.
The fourth side opened toward the western sea,
And round it at low water shining kelps
Came out like flowing-purple pansy beds
Upon the grape-bloom surface just as dusk
And shadowy cliffs began their rendezvous.
Industriously he hauled his lobster pots;
And dawn was sure to find him every day
Out jigging round or pulling at his warps,
Or squinting toward the toggles in the sunlight,
Whose every trap contained a gambler's chance.
What joy was in his eyes these morning hours
When four or five count lobsters bronze or black
Were clinging to the pot-heads or the laths,
As he broke out a trap across the stern!
What blessedness was his when wearied out
By struggles with the tide and heavy hauling
He came ashore and felt the spindrift touch

Of her whose life gave lightness to his own;
Whose smile could compensate for small returns
Of dreary days, or toll of raging storms
That passed him not whenever northeast gales
Pranced up the coast, stirring the undertow
To launch its heavy gales against the cliffs
In never-ending roar of deafening salvos,-
The artillery music of storm-bitten caves.
Another year their bud of happiness
Bewilderingly bloomed a miracle,
And as they gazed on his rose-petaled face,
And read love's meaning in his sea-blue eyes,
They felt their natures wedded once again.
His gurgles, smiles, and yawns so filled their minds
That they would pinch themselves to make secure
They were not dwelling in a world of dream.
Out hauling on the bay the minutes flew
Like happy gulls, in spite of jelly fish
And gurry smarting on his sun-burned arms,
Till he was back to see the boy again;
And when the baby's first white tooth came through,
He scraped a rusty pen and squared himself
To share the event with three far distant friends

Two winsome years; then heaven smiled once more,
And brought these two another miracle,
A cuddling, smiling daughter who unclosed
From brother's heart the tendrils of her father's
And placed them firmly round her helpless own.
One daughter more, and four dirt-healthy boys
Arrived to weigh the drudging mother down,
And make her picture heaven in terms of rest.
At forty with a troop of happy children
Exulting daily round his little cottage,
The father read the book of life anew.
His wife, child-conscious, merging every thought
In seven offspring, lived again in them
The smiles and tears of childhood, and, in dreams,
Would long to spend a Sunday afternoon
Upon the headland basking in the sun,
Enraptured in her husband's lusty arms;
While he dismissed all dream-romance like this
As silly folly, laughed her out of mood,
And puttering round the fish-house, headed traps,
Rigged haddock trawls, or cleaned his twelve gage gun,

Preparing for the time when coots would dot
The bay, and send his sporting biood to mounting.
Here his romantic youth came back again:
A late October chill swept up the bay,
And codfish slowly swam around the rocks
With questioning heads and ever-moving tails,
And dressed themselves the color of the kelps.
The gray coots followed, and, in big, black flocks,
Took feed around half-sunken, iron ledges
That struggled through the ocean at half tide.
He picks a morning when the sea is still
And low tide tallying even with the sunrise.
The night before he patches tollers' heads,
Makes ready boats and guns, and scans the weather.
His grown sons go to bed with all clothes on
For fear the early morn will find them napping.
They startle at the creaking of a door,
Or dead leaf blown against the window pane;
And when they smell the coffee down below,
Leap out of bed and clamber down the stairs,
And, in high spirits, rouse a white ash breeze,

That speeds their boat toward ledges lying calm
As whales or blackfish on the dark gray tide.
The tollers anchored twenty yards away,
They go ashore and pull the dory up
Within the crevice of a ledge, and crouch
Shivering, with eye and gun alert for action.
"Heads down," is whispered from the man to windward,
And twenty seconds later as the spray
Is kicked up by the web feet through the water,
Off go the guns and three gray birds collapse;
Cold faces glow, as coots and old-squaws fall
Beneath the banging guns inflamed with joy;
While out of the sea the salmon-tinted sun
Illuminates the clinging periwinkles
To match the kindled faces of the men.
At sixty his old double-barreled gun
Lay rusting in the corner, for the boys
No longer coaxed him out across the bay.
His sons were grown to manhood: one, a dreamer,
Took lessons of an artist, and became
A landscape painter, worshiping his art,
Returning every summer to recapture
The color in the islands and the waves.

Another went away and won his place
Among the engineers of Michigan,
Came back for brief vacations, and displayed
A never-ceasing restlessness beside
The wharfs and fish-houses along the beach,
And wished the languorous, loafing mood of youth
Might once again be his, but wished in vain.
The other five remained at home, or moved
To nearby towns, and lived the cycle over
Of village joys and sorrows, births and deaths,
Their parents knew for sixty seasoned years.
It is these make up the children of the globe,
Whose fiction is the folk-lore of the hills,
Whose music is the moaning of the sea,
Whose pictures are the headlands and the ships
Through all the generations of mankind.
The mother saw her children's children come,
And felt the flower-like bliss of motherhood
Flow through her aged arteries again;
She dressed more neatly, smiled benignantly,
Beamed in the presence of her strapping boys,
And blushed to hear her husband's tongue wag free
Of love to her long after love's repose.

At seventy his wet, neglected youth
Began to tell upon his brittle limbs.
He wore brass chains around his wrists to ward
Away rheumatic twinges, but the chains
Of age restrained him like a great sheet anchor.
He puttered round the fish-house, telling over
The days of wrecks, wild storms, and mackerel schools
That plugged the coves and rotted on the flats;
Found fault with newer ways of younger men,
And felt the beauty of the northeast storms,
The beauty of the spruce trees mirrored in
The cove at sunset when no ripple stirred,
As he had felt them fifty years before.
One bright May morning spring seduced him off
To dig a peck of clams and steal away
Before the others of the house were up,
To handline cod far out on Long Point Shoal.
The wind blew on, he drifted out to sea
Till he was lost to sight beyond the bay.
The coast guards breasted combers mountains high,
But all in vain, for no one learned his fate.
His wherry drifted on a sandy beach
Full twenty miles away,-his barvel, pipe,

Among the oars, and gaffs, and fishing-lines;
But not a trace of what had taken him
Was ever wheedled from the witching sea.
Night after night his wife kept supper hot,
And stood at sunset many and many an evening,
A grandchild in her arms, and gazed and gazed
Out toward the eastern headland hopefully,
To see his wherry coming round the point.
Reluctantly the children led her in
Out of the chill of evening, but the light
That shone from out her eyes and on her face
Persuaded them she caught a passing glimpse
Of his familiar features in the twilight.
She stayed with them from May till early Fall,
And when the maple leaves flared wine-like crimson,
She rested from her watching, and reached out
Her hand to greet her mate of three score ten,
And mix her dust with earth, as his was mixed
With kelps and seaweed of the cleansing sea.

COUNTRY FUNERAL
The mother, lying on a couch, brought down
By loving hands from chill, damp chamber rooms,
Breathes out her last faint breath; the men
Who watch try gently to convey, in speech
Whose tones supply the touch of sympathy
The Saxon phrases lack, the grim, stark truth
Of death, forever old, forever new.
Bewildered comes the aged father up
To verify the heavy news he hoped
Would never reach his ears; he calls her name
So piteously the neighbors turn away
And leave him for a minute all alone.
The children venture in: one, wailing loudly,
No longer tries to hold her pent-up anguish;
Another calms himself, but cords that swell
Along his neck betray his grief no less.
A neighbor cautions, "Eben, don't

And David scans the weekly till he finds
The county undertaker's shapely card:
"In case of death call up the Funeral Home,"
And Johnson's number stamped in bold, black type.
An hour later Johnson, robed in furs,
Steps softly in and grasps old Eben's hand
With firmer grasp than country people know,
Removes a black fur cap which hides a mat
Of flattened hair across a sloping brow,
"Too bad, you had a lovely wife;

And says,
I'm sorry to be summoned down on this
Sad errand here to-night. I mourn with you,
And feel as if a dear one of my own
Had just gone out and left me sorrowful.

Of course, you'll not want anything that's cheap
For such a wife: the only thing for her
Is what we call a couch-casket; you'll want
My motor hearse, and everything just right;
And I'll take special pains to come myself
To see that everything goes smooth and straight.”

"But jest about how much will all this cost?"
"We'll not talk money matters here to-night;
I know your grief, and know that you will want
The very best of everything for her."
And Eben, groping feebly in the dark,
Takes Johnson's word and says, "All right, you make
The price as reasonable as you can make it.
I own my home, jest paid the last in June,
And that's as far as my poor ownings go.
I ain't had nary job of stiddy work
For 'most three years, my rheumatiz is bad.
But I will pay you anything you say
If
you will only take into account
My circumstances and my feeble health,

And be as easy on me as you can.'
The cottage funeral two days later draws
The villagers for many miles around.
For two sad days a vigil has been kept
Beside the coffin-old-time country custom;
For two days neighbors have brought cakes and pies
And other gifts of food, sincerest tokens,
Worth more than speeches, which they cannot make.

Beside the casket, and reads, deeply moved,
"Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe,"
And feels his faith acceptable to all
Who loved the wife, now pillowed beautifully
In marble-featured, calm-bestowing death.
The nearest relatives, swathed deep in black,
Are seated in a row of chairs fetched in
From nearby houses, and the undertaker,
In black Prince Albert and glum cleric air,
Whispers the proper order of their seating.
The sermon tells, in simple sentences
Touched with a note of rhetoric here and there,
The woman's sweet, maternal sacrifice
Throughout a rigorous, uncomplaining life,
And magnifies the melancholy hour
With deep emotion and huge thoughts of death;
And when he closes with a prayer for those,
The nearest and the dearest of the circle,
The helpless wails of sorrowing hearts break out
In sobs that drown the Bible words of hope.

And softly bids the neighbors pass around

In careful order of priority;
While in the rear the neighbors of the village
Trudge pensively and once again revisit
The plot where their own kin return to dust.
A few weeks later comes a courteous letter
With entries totaling four hundred dollars.
The bent old father whitens as he reads
This mortgage on his future life and home;
A heaviness draws down his face, the light
Departs, and silence weightier than speech
Enwraps him like a prison where one goes
To serve a lonely term of bitter years;
And in a scrawling hand he makes reply,
Signing the paper which he finds within,—
Surrendering his last, lame, broken days
To ruthless perpetuity of debt.

FOG
The big battalions of the fog, whose dark
Gray horses kick up clouds of dust, roll in
And shut from sight the amber-dazzling sea,
Blanking the coast with stifling camouflage.
The lighthouse men, with peering sharp sea-faces,
Start up the boiler in the whistle house
Or bell house on the fast-receding coast;
And soon the deafening blasts or deep-toned bells
Begin to fire at the oncoming host,
Exploding screams or booming dismally
In fierce bombardment through the long, dark night,—
Enough, my boy's heart felt, to scare the fog
Itself to an unstrategic, wild retreat.
How frightened as a child I stopped my ears
Before that screeching, unrelenting whistle,
And pictured it as some huge beast in pain!
How stifled have I stood upon the headland
Beside the lighthouse of my island home

FOG
And watched a schooner blossom from the fog
Arrestingly as flowers halt a man
Who, for the first time after dreary months,
Beholds them pushing from a bed of snow
In some Alaskan valley late in May!
Out of the mist into expectant eyes
These ships bore merchandise through phantom seas,
Enveloped in dim watery clouds of gray,
And filled unjaded hearts with brilliant dreams
Of fairy vessels sailing Blue Bird seas
With Orient cargoes that cannot come in
On this mechanic, trade-and-profit earth
Of reinforced concrete and drudgery.
How many hours have I watched the fog
Sway in and out with rhythmic rise and fall
Like winds that fill the sails of all the trees,
Before dissolving back to pregnant calm!
For fog, too, has its seasons, like the winds,
High tides, and flowers, and months, and evening stars!
It weaves impressionistic colors on
The canvas of the air, till every cove,
And bay, and bight, and harbor is blurred out;
All silently it then comes up the shore,

FOG
And inland for the space of half a mile
Spreads over hay fields and low alder swamps,
.
Hanging small pearls on spruce limbs, ferns, and
grasses;
And when it has obscured the sea and sky
So hopelessly that noonday turns to night,
It stands, like a dissatisfied creator,
And rubs again the canvas of the air,
Letting the sunlight play on it once more,
And letting joy play upon the boatsman's eyes
That could not see ten yards before the mast,
And feared a crash while fumbling through the dark.
One afternoon upon the coast of Maine,
When fog banks had been mulling for a week,
Keeping the bay and coves in one profound
Blank wall of gray and dripping nothingness,
That dimmed the pounding of the rolling breakers,
I saw Zeb Kinney's wherry coming in
Beside the wharf, and went to see him land.
He placed a killock on his wherry's bow
Caressingly, and shoved her from the wharf
A dozen yards, then yanked the painter quick,

And, tying a bowline round a cedar stake,
Said "There" with such a comprehensive note
Of grim finality, I set myself
The task of learning what was in his mind,
And, for the lack of something better, said,
"What's your opinion, Uncle Zeb, of fog?"
He looked at me as if he half discerned
That I knew he was ripe for homely speech,
As salty as the fish scales on his boots,
And he must measure up to expectations:
"Well, I was thinkin', if you have to know,
Th' ain't so much to choose 'twixt gettin' by
In life and steerin' out there through the fog.
The most of us go out to haul without
A compass or a thing, and steer along,
As Andrew Elwell says, 'By guess and by God.'
We can't see fifty feet before our eyes,
And lose ourselves in pockets where the sound
Of fog horns cannot reach,-we don't know why.
We cock our ears and listen for the rote
Around the ledges, restin' on our oars.
We hear the toot of tugs and dread the tow rope,

Right underneath the bow; and yet in spite
Of all our fears, we somehow pick our way,

Th' ain't two things I know so much alike
As gettin' by and jiggin' through the fog."

"The Abbie S. is comin' in to get
A load of New York pavin'." At this word
We joined the gang that sauntered toward the wharf,
Caught flounders, went in swimming, skipped flat stones,
Or listened to the golden cadences
Of old Tom Wiley's stories: how the boys
Of other days ran off and went to sea
At fourteen years, and how they made
The South Sea Islands in a raging storm,
Were blown away, and forced to spend a month
Among the palm trees, and the cocoanuts,
And naked cannibals with dark brown skins.
Old men like Tom had always gone to sea
On huge square-riggers; they despised windjammers
Far more than we abominated barges;
And one, who twitched a pirate's hardened mouth,
Whose eyes were bloody, and whose leathery fists
Were always clenched as if expecting trouble,
Who wore stout cowhide boots, the last red pair

Growled out that morning in a frightening tone,
While this three-master glided up the cove:
"I hate these homely hookers scootin' round,
Pretendin' they're as good as old time ships,
When them as knows can see they don't come up
In any way; they jest ain't ships at all!
I always did steer clear of barkentines,
And 'morphodite' brigs, and wasn't much on barks;
But them was paradise 'longside o' these.
Why, these fresh gaff-and-boom things rile me so
I don't know how to speak the way I feel:
I'd rather be hanged on board a square-rigger
Than die a natural death on board a fore-and-after!”
By this time Abbie S. had downed her jibs
And topsails; we could hear the captain shout
His orders, see the sailors run the deck:
Among them four resilient, shambling negroes,
The first to fill our childish eyes with wonder,
Who trimmed the sheets in rhythm, coiled up rope,
And stopped to see her luff into the wind.
Around the vessel swung her stately nose,

And ranged too far ahead, till, at the wharf,
Big hawsers were flung out, made quickly fast,
And, like a wild horse at a snubbing post,
She shuddered in her tracks, and came to rest.
The old men looked her over, stem to stern,
And made no outward comment, but their eyes
Flared wistful, mellow gleams, betraying memories
Of balmy southern seas with full-rigged ships
Cleaving the blue, beneath the Southern Cross,
All ports on earth their havens, youth their pass
From Bangor, Maine, to Hong Kong and Bombay.
As these gray sea-dogs scanned the far horizon
And prophesied dread changes in the weather,
Two noisy, high-wheeled dumpcarts rumbled and
rattled,
And hauled the paving to the dock for loading.
Four stout longshoremen, biceps strong as cables,
The color of the Abbie S.'s spars,
Gray stone-dust sprinkled on their arms and eyebrows,
Kept tally, hurling blocks down iron chutes,
While all around the rackety, clattering hubbub
Drove off the crying flocks of frightened sea-gulls

The lanky teamsters yelled
Commands that carried echoes half a mile;
And when the pin was loosened from the dumpcart
The deafening crash of stone startled the horses
Who jumped about and switched their bushy tails,
Moving their hind legs quickly up and down.
The driver, yelling "Whoa," put back the pin
And joggled off to haul another hundred.
The din of counting went on ceaselessly;
The grinding of the rim-bands on the grout bank,
The frequent crash of dumping from the high carts,
Struck in with granite-crunching thuds resounding
In hard metallic thumps along the stone-chutes.
Five days the work went on; noon of the sixth,
A choppy high tide lapping over the gray rocks,
The deck was cleared to put again to sea.
Clack-clack, the blocks replied, as the halyards tightened;
And, foot by foot, the sails arose to greet
The warm west breeze, heavy with scent of orchards.
The sails bulged out; the captain grew self-conscious,
And left the wheel to inspect the water barrels;
The heavy hawsers, cast off, hit the water,

THE "ABBIE S." LOADS PAVING
And bit by bit the hooker gathered headway.
We watched the foam lashed up amid the green
To darker, swirling green beneath her stern.
The wharf was jammed with chattering festive people
Who waved their hats, and hands, and handkerchiefs:
Dull men grew witty, and the eyes of all
Were burnished like a gay yacht's glittering brass-works.
The crew doffed caps and swung a last good-by
As the Abbie S., winged out, moved past the headland,
And boldly plunged to greet the Atlantic gales,
Merging one more dream-carrier with the horizon.
To-day these paving "motions" are all stilled.
The blacksmith shops, where once the tinkle of iron
Resounded clink-clank-clink the seasons through,
Are drooping to a rusty, bronze decay,
And asphalt fills the old-time call for blocks.
The Abbie S., dismantled and worn out,
Asleep upon the flats where all is silent,
Makes picturesque designs for city artists,
While vessels of her make are giving way
To ugly barges bearing coastwise freight,
For fair white sails no longer dot the ocean.
And we, like Tom's gray crew a lap before us

THE "ABBIE S." LOADS PAVING
(The last one now at rest upon the hillside
Beneath a granite anchor for his headstone),
Bewail the coming in of barges towed
By grimy tugs; we long to see white canvas,
And rigging looking delicate at sunset,
When lace-like shadows flicker on the water,
And fifty vessels lying in the harbor
Transmute themselves at dusk into a fleet
Of fairy, phantom ships whose marvelous spell
Once more flings back an answer to man's craving
Confronted by the deep call of the sea.

THE DENUDED ISLAND
"Why have you taken away
My children, and left me deserted,
With only the water beneath
Shuddering, bitterly chill?
Would I might all at once settle
Into this cold, green water!
"Alas, I must silently stand
Cold and gray and bare,
A rock in the bleak, cold ocean
Awaiting the endless erosion
Of the myriad, long-lagging centuries;
I, who was once as fresh
As the spruce trees growing in clumps
Down to the water's edge,
Sacredly green and still
On early autumn mornings,-
Keeping the winter wind
From blowing the puffs off my back;
Luring the birds to my dwelling

THE DENUDED ISLAND
In the first warm preludes of spring:
The glossy blue-black crows
Cawing out of the branches
On silvery rainy mornings;
The chickadees scattering music
As if the limbs of the trees
Were stops in a finely-tuned instrument,
And they the official musicians;
The fish-hawks whom nobody ventured
To shoot at lest bad luck attend him,
Circling around at low tide,
Diving into the eel-grass,
Bringing out mussels and clams,
Dropping them down on the rocks
For their young ones hungrily crying
From big nests in mammoth dead trees.
"Even the fish-hawks are gone,
And I am left gray and alone,
Exposed to the storms of November,-
Gray as the aged gulls
That cry as they circle around me,
Gray as the voice of the loon,
The saddest note of the shoreline.

THE DENUDED ISLAND
"O choppers and builders of weirs,
Why could you not have spared
My younger, willowy children,—
My saplings pungent and slim
From whom I again could have builded
A forest race once more,
To tangle the sea in its hair,
And lay out the tempting white snow
As bait for the moon's yellow foxes
That streak along in the night
And gild the flickering water;
Willowy, evergreen spruces
Dreamily taking a moon bath;
Birches as crisply white
As a young girl's soft, round shoulders;
Suddenly-opening groves
Like naves of Gothic cathedrals,
With a cool green light overhead
And below glints of shiny bronze sunsets
Through the ever-brown boles of the spruces
Like the great rose window of Chartres;-
My younger, willowy children,
For sailors to look at and brood on,
For fisher boys rowing their sweethearts

Toward Sunday embraces at twilight,
For the glassy calm mirror of ocean
Loving to catch on its surface
Contrasting white clouds and green trees
In a still nook of slanting black ledges?

You choppers and builders of weirs,
And leave me a rock in the ocean
With never a bird or an alder
To soften my rest through the ages?"

THE EAGLE
A hundred king-birds flying near our ship
On Fundy's Bay becalmed, one glassy morning,
When white sails quivered and the reefpoints flapped,
Could not as much as stir the drowsy crew,
Swabbing down decks and parching in the sun,
To lift their eyes above the galley stove-pipe
Till, from the North, a grim, bald-headed eagle
Swooped in among the flock exultingly,
Causing a flutter, as a great world figure
Bestirs an audience that has waited hours.
The king-birds swarmed about and heckled him,
Setting us all blood-hot to take his part;
And when their heckling grew so violent
They clung to him as barnacles to rocks,
In ever-widening circles up he soared
With scores of groundlings darting in his wake.
We watched them, baffled, drop off one by one;
Now twelve were left; now five; now only three;
And finally, with one victorious wheel,

THE EAGLE
He thrust his golden wings through the yielding blue,
Till heights divided his majestic being
From birds that never knew the upper air.
From spellbound admiration we tore loose
And cheered him as we would a racing yacht
Defeating rivals in a piping breeze.
I came back to my squeegee suddenly,
And never on this planet do I hope
To look upon a countenance so transfigured
As was our mate's funereal, cidery face,-
Our mate, a shattered mast, his warped hands trembling,
His mouth proclaiming cynic dissipation,
His slouchy clothes announcing him a failure;
Yet his brown eyes at times flashed smoldering fires,
And when he straightened up to give an order,
We felt behind him clean-cut generations,
And sensed a tithe of what he might have been.
"You wonder, Bill, what's running through my mind,”
He took my arm and led me toward the anchors,
"I'll tell you, Bill, I read the Bible once;
I read, and learned by heart a place which said

THE EAGLE
That 'they who waited on the Lord renewed
Their strength: they mounted up on mighty wings
Like eagles; they would run and not be weary,
Would walk and not be faint.' The man who wrote
That text, Bill, must have seen a flight like this.”
He stopped; and I respected what was in
His eyes enough to keep the silence with him,
While forces not of earth like giant tides
Of Fundy's Bay were flooding ugly flats
And dingy marshes of his low-drained life.
He left the ship at Montreal, and bore
The lighted countenance and eagle mood
When he shook hands good-by.
I watched him lose
Himself among the crowds that filled the dock,
While fragrances of dusk were wafted inland,
And stars were coming out above the harbor:
A wounded eagle, game for one more flight,
He seemed a soul apart,-his wistful face
Deep bronze and mystic, hauntingly detached,
The timid sailor just ashore, at strife
With that which wakened when he saw the ascent.

THE RETURN
His wanderings in Western states were wide:
He knew the velvet greens of Oregon,
The deep rich blues of Crater and Tahoe,
The splendor of the Rocky Mountain peaks,
The sun-burned Arizona mesas stretched
In far-flung, weird, fantastic pageantry;
The fragrance of the desert sage at dawn,
The blood red sunsets on the Great Salt Lake,-
He knew and loved them all. And yet the soil,
The harsh New England soil was calling him,
And would not give him peace till he resolved
To write the old folks he was coming back.
A dreary week across the continent,
With sooty cars, and jangling engine shrieks,
Monotony of corn fields and delays,
Then four glad miles between him and his home.
October's wine-like air caressed his cheek,
Wine-colored leaves clung to the maple trees,

THE RETURN
And out across the east the sun came up
Turning to wine the pearl-gray wastes of sea.
Each turn of road brought back a childhood scene:
Here stood a dam his boyhood gang once built
To overflow a field for winter skating;
And here, beneath an alder limb, they caught
A rabbit in a snare, and felt ashamed
To see the blood upon the snow next morning;
And here they built two forts, and, choosing sides,
Played North and South for many a Saturday;
And here the hill where lady's-slippers grew
For his delight through warm, sweet days of spring
(New England spring, a rush of ecstasy),
And for a childhood sweetheart whom he gave
These pink surprises like her soft, pink face,
Telling her they were shoes of whippoorwills.
He turned the final corner of the road,
And straight before him loomed the willow tree
And cottage white and green beyond its shadow.
He crossed the threshold, warped and worn, to greet
The kindliness within the eyes of her

THE RETURN
Who filled his mother's place,-his mother free
Ten years before from life's New England winter;
He thrilled to see his weather-beaten father,
Now gray and hardy, a New England oak,
Four-square to life's bleak-beating northeast gales,
Nobility in every deep-lined seam
That scarred his face for sixty Spartan years.
With eager eyes he climbed the steep back stairs
To view the spot he always called his own,
The room whose walls, if they could speak, might tell
Of high resolves, and dreams, and voyages,
From wanting to grow up a sailor man
To pioneering for a world set free;
But there he found the choking musty smells
Far different from his Western expectations,
And, baffled, raised the little chamber window.
He roamed about the house from nook to nook,
And in his sister's empty room he saw
A big brown teddybear a chum and he
Had brought to make her Christmas joys complete
When they came back from college, Sophomores.
A thousand lovely memories clustered round
72


## p. 73 (#87) ##############################################

THE RETURN
That teddybear, whose faded tie of blue
Was all in order now, and soft with dust.
The rooms that echoed laughter year by year,
That rang alive all day with romping din,
Alive all night with breathing, dreaming children,
Were now as empty as his empty heart.
A breezy Western merchant he had come
Expecting time, like all things else, to stand
Aside at his steel-girdered wilfulness,
But this search found him on the traceless path,
The path that leads one to the dreams of youth.
Realities, he learned, were foes of dreams:
Realities were cold, though robed in furs,
And dreams were warm, despite all poverty;
His hope in coming back was vanity,
And all his dream-prints blurred with choking dust.
Dejectedly he stumbled down the stairs,
And from the small verandah he could hear
The vigorous, far-off music of the sea,—
'Twas not for child's play that majestic sound
Had thundered on his inner ear at birth,
Or been the tuning-fork his ancestry
73


## p. 74 (#88) ##############################################

THE RETURN
For countless generations had obeyed
To pitch their song of life to, when in need.
He caught the dauntless note its iron voice
Forever sings to lift the hearts of men
To face life's great defeat unfalteringly.
It lifted him from caverns of despair
As sunlight cheered him after musty rooms;
And with a heart as far from desolate
As ledges on the harbor from decay,
He watched a rolling wave break on the bar,
And turned to tell the old folks of the West.

CRUMP HOOK
When war broke out in 'Seventeen
The Flanders' slaughter house had been
So deftly flashed on Western eyes
By propaganda's dark disguise
That China's thousand warless years
Rang like cries of bayoneteers
Against our profiteering joy
And songs like "Didn't Raise My Boy."
Crump Hook decided not to go,
Likewise his sidekick, lazy Joe.
But when they saw each buck in place
With clean brown suit and clean brown face,
And saw good dogs forsake the city
For barracks life austere and gritty;
And saw the lights that glittered through
Girls' eyes on Thursday's gay review;

And found themselves despised and lonely
With old rheumatic cripples only,
Their marching feet would not keep still
Till they joined the hunt for Kaiser Bill.
The draft-board patriots looked amazed
As on these two old bums they gazed;
And one from his vest-pocket dug
A blackened, lint-strewn, five-cent plug,
And gave to Crump with gesture free
To vent his magnanimity.
The doctor, with a stethoscope,
Came out and scanned these dregs of hope;
Forlornly muttered, "This way, boys,"
And like two convicts sick for noise
They took ten steps and heard their doom
Pronounced by Science; Oh, the gloom
That weighed them down as they walked out
And felt the world sink round about

Their eyes as they moved off to impart
That one had hernia, one weak heart.
No martyrs crucified or burned
Felt worse than these two hulks interned,
The day the company, banners wide,
Marched through the streets with splendid stride,
And sang such songs as "Over There"
Before the pastor offered prayer;
And just to add a New England touch
Lest gaiety be stretched too much,
Some woman started, "We Shall Meet
Beyond the River," and the beat
Of that grave hymn portrayed the mood
In Uncle Sam's crusading blood.
That afternoon the old main street
Took on a look more gray and neat
Than any Crump had felt before;
But as he thought his heart grew sore,

Till he resolved to drown his troubles
In Prohibition booze's bubbles.
They seize Crump's speedy motor-craft,
Clean-lined and slim from fore to aft,
And chug-chug down to Barney's Inn,
A place unspeakable of sin,
With wine and women, but little song
To hold a true Bohemian long.
A pair of hardwood cellar stairs,
The gang plank of the John F. Sayres,
Led to the forecastle below,
And when their eyes began to grow
Accustomed to the light, they viewed
Five men, in various stages, stewed.
A veteran of the Civil War
With long white beard, stood up and swore
That Yanks could fight, by God, the best
Of all earth's soldiers, East or West.

A fat, good-natured silent rummy
Rose from the corner like a dummy
Propelled by wires, and exclaimed
"Hurray," and sank back unashamed.
As the war talk buzzed, two fading flowers
Felt meanly stung with the stinging hours,
For ten good shots had made them strong
Enough to lick the German throng
That bayoneted Belgian babies
And filled the wells with germs of rabies.
If Uncle Sam could throw them down,
They'd have revenge or wreck the town.
So clambering up the gangway scuttle
They tried a trick more grim than subtle.
The stars and stripes above the Inn
Waved softly and expressed chagrin,
Or so they thought, as Crump and Joe
Unloosed the halyards and hauled low

The flag, and quick as lightning's flash
Tied two rum bottles on the lash
And hoisted them to the flagpole's top
And cheered till they were like to drop.
The hundred per centers down below,
Alert to any brand of show
From a dog fight to a three-ring tent,
Rushed up the gang plank, action bent,
And saw the worst the town had staged
Since Tories snooped around enraged.
They 'phoned big Constable Ballou
To come and see this business through;
And down he plunged, his ardor burning
While the two ran off, and quickly turning
The wheel, sped past the lobster cars,
Wetting their rusty iron bars.
The sheriff saw them making off,
And though he knew the veteran's cough

Was in itself a hint that law
Was not exactly held in awe
At Barney's grim, secluded place,
He winked at this, but blazed in the face
To see those two rum bottles hung
Where the Stars and Stripes had proudly flung.
The sheriff said, "I'll teach them scum
A lesson if you two will come"
(He pointed to a sober pair
Of fishermen whose boat lay there)
"And let me have your motor wherry
To catch them blatherskites, by Jerry."
The three sped South without delay
And flew across Penobscot Bay;
The lobster men along the coast
Came out and watched; one lined a post
Across the bight to see which gained
Upon the other, as they strained.

Five bets were made; cool heads grew hot,
And one was asked to hold the pot.
But nature had to spoil the fun,
For just as they were well begun
A fog bank drifted in toward shore
And nothing but a distant oar
Within a rowlock, or a sound
Of motor chugging out around
Was left to guide the expectant crowd,
Whose fervor now was deep and loud.
More zealous still were the racing crews;
They hardly knew what course to choose;
But Crump cared least, and let her slide
Down channel, gas valve open wide;
A glorious hour of chase he sped,
Then two big breakers loomed ahead;
And soon more breakers in commotion
White-crested on the dark green ocean
82


## p. 83 (#97) ##############################################

CRUMP HOOK
Sent fear along Crump's trembling breast,
And made Joe's teeth seethe like the crest
On top the wave just after breaking;
They wondered what cove they were making
If cove at all, and Joe shouts, "Pull
The switch off, Crump, or we'll swamp full.”
Crump stopped the boat, and listening
Could hear a bell buoy's ding-dong-ding;
Could hear tugs shrieking up the bay,
Their sirens warning, "Clear the way;"
Could hear the noisy tuck-tuck-tuck
Of gasoline boats out of luck;
Could hear the breakers all about them
Roll up and break, enough to rout them,
If one should break beneath their bow;
And Joe whined, "Crump, where are we now?”
Said Crump, "I'll tell you where we are,
I hear the rote on Sheepscot Bar;

I'd know it if it broke in hell,
I've heard it break for such a spell
Of years out round here haulin' pots."
Just then it broke in hell; green knots
Of water heaped themselves together
On the starboard side like a great bell-wether,
And growing horns of widening white,
Came tearing through with plunging might
And butted mercilessly down
Their craft and left them there to drown.
The ice-cold water chilled their knees
And backs till they were like to freeze;
But both could swim, and out they struck
Relying on the Lord and luck.
A big wave caught them in its hand
And washed them on the rocks and sand.
A flock of sandpeeps on the beach
Flew up and wheeled well out of reach;

They preened themselves and jerked their tails,
Spread out their wings like new white sails,
And wondered who had come so rude
To wreck their homely solitude.
Our heroes staggered up the shore
And flopped like two drowned rats; Joe swore
His knee and elbow both were breaking
With painful-tingling, ceaseless aching.
A chill wind pierced their bodies through
Like a splitting knife; their hands turned blue;
Like groggy fighters up they crawled,
Found them a cave securely walled
And went to sleep. The sheriff's packet
In blind pursuit slowed down its racket
And steered a far more cautious track
Among the buoys red and black.
They shut their engine off and strained
Their ears, so sensitively trained

CRUMP HOOK
By custom, they could quickly tell
Crump's engine from the rest, and fell
To wondering why its chug-chug-chug
Had altogether ceased; they dug
A compass from the ditty box
And took their bearings from the rocks
They knew most accurately, when
The keener of the sheriff's men
Made out a speck of gray-blue flannel
Swift floating down the foggy channel;
They reached for it and found Crump's hat,
And near at hand Joe's derby, flat.
A bailing scoop, a lobster measure
Confirmed the worst; at once their pleasure
Gave way to honest neighbor sorrow;
"The town will hate us all to-morrow,

They thought, cursed deep their zeal and turned
Their wherry round and homeward churned.

The betting crew that lined the wharf
Looked once and knew all bets were off;
They hurried home and told their wives
Who mourned the loss of two gay lives
That gave the village half its lore
Of evening jokes at the grocery store.
"Well, Crump was not half bad," they said,
"He mended many a broken sled
For children, and repaired the toys
And jackknives of a hundred boys;
And Joe got up a sawing bee
For Widow Barnes in nineteen three,
And made such fun, with all his fuss,
He'll be more missed than ten of us.”
The pastor thought a service fitting
For these two men, and at one sitting
All hands said, "Yes," and three days later
The village church enclosed a greater

Array of folk than ever dressed
For Sunday meeting in their best.
Meanwhile our pair on Sheepscot Bar
Had sobered off; a lobster car
Had served them for a place to sleep;
They drank from fresh springs cool and deep;
They lived on berries red and blue
And watched to see the sun burst through
Its thick damp cover; those three days
Had made them vow to mend their ways.
At ten the third long-lagging day
A sloop from the islands in the bay
Slid by and saw our Crusoe, Crump,
And his man Friday on a stump,
And sent a tow boat toward their station
To break their sober isolation.
Three hours more; they reached the town
And seeing carriages, swooped down

To church, determined to find out
What all the rumpus was about.
They poked their heads past a window sill
Just as a hymn closed; all was still.
The pastor said, "We know the sin
That took our two late brethren in;
It was the demon rum, whose powers
Have wrecked so many a home of ours;
The German curse outraged their sense
Of decency and right, and hence
They burned to go avenge the shame
Of bleeding Belgium in God's name.
They had their faults, as most men do,
But to the old flag they were true,
And I would wrap around Crump's shroud
Its folds of which we're all so proud.
It is not ours to judge their crime,
We leave them to the Lord and time."

MIKE
I see him yet, as he stood there that day,
I but a boy of nine, he three score two,—
I see him, dressed in brand new heavy tweed,
That made him like a stranger on the lawn,
Instead of my dear, playful, singing comrade.
I felt myself resent his new gray suit
And new brown cane, with silver top, that took
The place of maple, elm, or birch shillalahs
He was forever losing in the dooryard.
In pride and dignity he stood that morning:
His hair and beard as white as Arctic snow,
Arbutus-tinted skin, inquiring nose,
His left leg stiff, his left eye robbed of light,
A ticket back to Ireland firmly sewed
Inside his coat, and in his heart a cry
That he might stay with us and die in peace.
Old Mike had lived with us for fourteen years,
Till, when our last small sister came, he swore
91


## p. 92 (#106) #############################################

MIKE
He would no longer be beholden to us.
As eldest son he would go back and claim
His half-forgot, ancestral property;
And as he talked there rose before him prospects,
Mixed up with emerald memories of youth,
Of cows, and sheep, and green, well-ordered gardens
In which he heard the cuckoo and the blackbird
So sweetly that his tongue framed living pictures
Until the loafing neighbors gathered round him
Thrilled to the bone at his romancing powers.
An independence pitiful to see
Awakened in that battered derelict
One morning as he sailed the dusty road,
And stopped to tell his plans to other wrecks,
Declaring he would voyage once again
To Bally Brack, Killarney, County Kerry,
And live with sister Mary till he died.
A large, well-meaning, noisily-breathing woman,
With gold-rimmed spectacles and olive skin,
Who clipped her words in crisp, emphatic manner,
Hearing Mike's story and capricious wish,
Went promptly out to raise an ample purse
And send the homeless pilgrim back to Ireland.

MIKE
A paper she put out among the stonesheds
And round the quarries where they all knew Mike,
Soon brought the means to fit him for his journey.
The day now come, he half refused to go.
The Black Ball liner he came over on
Twice twenty years before, had met with storms
And nearly foundered; children died like rats,
And sickness made the steerage one long nightmare.
The vision of return now meant to him
That rancid voyage over once again,
And gloomier than before, for youth's red blood
No longer spurred his hesitating body
And lifted hardship to adventurous heights.
Another fear preyed up and down the streets
And alleys of his mind-the gnawing dread
That drink would whisper, "Drown your woes, old man,
'Tis more than you can bear without my cheer."
He knew he could not brook the awful heartache
Of separation from us, knew his strength
Would crumple up beneath the chiseling teeth
Of that grim rat who never takes the count
When men like Mike are battling with temptation.

MIKE
With these forebodings in his heart, and tears
Making a delta of his Celtic face,
He stood beneath a silver maple tree
Which he had helped set out in our front yard
Just fourteen years before, and said good-by.
I slipped a paper in his trousers pocket
Which said, "I love you, Mike, come back some day."
Impatiently we waited for the letter
He promised us; he could not write himself,
But Mary had kept touch with us each year,
And well we knew her stamps and handwriting;
But two months passed before we heard a line,
In spite of my two letters crammed with news
Of cats, and dogs, and shinnying tricks, and children,
And then one night our mother read us this:
"My brother Michael came home crazy drunk,
And we two sisters scarce knew what to do.
He talked about his property in wild
Confusing speeches and so moithered us
We sent for the police; and when they learned
This poor old place would scarce bring a thraneen,
They sent him to the workhouse. There he is,
94


## p. 95 (#109) #############################################

MIKE
And we go up to see him every week.
He talks about the children all the time,
Especially the lad that wrote us twice;
And now he's whittling something grand for him,
He says he'll send by post at Christmas time.
He takes on hard, and rues the unlucky day
He left the States, and curses bitterly
The lady who made up the twenty pounds,
Till I stop up my ears and pray God's Mother
Forgive him for the awful state he's in.

When I heard this I ran off to the beach
And vowed there by the sea when I grew up
To dedicate my life toward raising money
To bring Mike back from Ireland to Maine.
""
A few months later came another note
From Mary telling us of one more voyage,
And this the last, that poor old Mike had taken.
"He seemed," the letter ran, "to be all right
In body, and the film that closed his eye
Had dropped away, and he could see like new.
But homesickness was always preying on him;

MIKE
Poor man, he could not read to pass the time,
And did not pay much mind to these new faces,
But called for Tim, and Dan, and other men
I never heard of, and your seven children.
He seemed to love them all, but most the lad
That wrote us letters in a fine, bold hand.
And I am posting this new top he made
Himself to send, he said the lad would love it.
I saw him just three days before he died,
And he appeared, I thought, unnatural bright.
He said the night before a big banshee
Had put his paws upon the bedroom window
And gazed with steady eyes for hours at him,
Making him feel his end was very near;
And would I send the Soggarth up at once
To say the blessed mass; of course, I did;
There's nothing more, except he wailed and wailed
That he came over, and he looked so sad
And called so loudly for the lad he loved
That I fell into keening there with him,
Until a keeper told me whisht my noise,
And I went home. Come Tuesday, Michael died,
God rest his soul.

MIKE
The story of this letter reached the neighbors
When they went for the mail that summer night;
And three of Mike's best friends-Dan, Tim, and Chris,
Made plans to have high mass said for his spirit
That it might voyage through to Paradise.

THE SAILBOAT
"I am a sailboat on life's racing waves
Beneath green headlands and a sapphire sky.
The motorboats rush by me haughtily
And kick up a commotion in the brine
Around me everywhere. I rear and toss
And lose all headway, fretted by the chop
These jiggling packets stir up on their rounds
From crowded island wharfs to fishing towns,
Shaking their sooty sterns at craft like me
Who love to keep the lanes of ocean white
With never-ending stretch of blooming canvas.
"When storms arise and turn the ocean's blue
To copper tints that strike the heart with fear,
And dark green squalls come hurtling from the west,
My pilot lets the anchor go, and furls
With care my flapping, rattling, bellying sails,
And arm in arm we ride the tempest through
In land-locked harbors walled with evergreen.
98


## p. 99 (#113) #############################################

THE SAILBOAT
"And longer still I wait when out at sea
I find myself upon the silken swell
Becalmed-no cloud above, reticulate ocean
Far as eye can reach on every hand.
Sleek porpoises, as black as naval guns,
Disturb the stillness with the stifled wheeze
That wins for them the sailors' 'Puffing Pigs.'
A crying sea-gull flaps serenely by;
And driftwood, floating with the eddying tide,
Looms up, entwined with seaweed parched and brown,
Stirring my wonder as it drops astern,
Till down the channel out of sight it glides,
Leaving me in a stilly, passive mood
Upon the calm sea-prairies of repose.
"But when an air springs up and tells the shrouds
In scarce-felt whispers from the purple tide
The coming of a spanking southwest breeze,
My master spreads completely every stitch
Of canvas, takes the helm, away I spin
Along the slapping waves, my sails bulged out
In rounded fullness gloriously white;
The foam-crest, boiling, bubbling at my bow,
Sings sailor chanteys to my pilot's ear,
99

THE SAILBOAT
And I am free and happy as the wind
That drives me as it drives the happy birds
Along the lime-green gullies of the sea.
"And now I reap reward for biding time
Through hurricane and blistering hours of calm;
The chugging motorboats with plunging strength
No longer do I envy; all good speed
I wish them as they sputter down the bay.
I heave to, at my mooring, and my sail
At sunset is a broad, white, flowing ribbon
Upon the pink neck of a gold-haired girl,
Touched by soft breezes, as my pilot bends
The hawser on and leaves me for the night,
Clasped to the lips and bosom of my love-
The rhythmic, breathing lady of the tides."

HAUNTED
There are strange noises around an old house at mid-
night,
When our minds are most awake.
Are they the forgotten owners coming back to make
themselves felt,
And throw off the oblivion to which we have so care-
lessly consigned them?
The shutters make a breathing sound
As if some faithful hired man
Had come back, and were using them for lungs.
A faint tinkle, as of iron, floats up from the cellar:
Is it the stirring of a former tenant
Trying to shake off death's chains?
A rooster calls out loudly two hours before his time.
I imagine he is greeting his old master
Who is rustling the leaves
Walking among the hollyhocks by the garden wall.
101


## p. 102 (#116) ############################################

HAUNTED
A bubble of earth resounds far off,
Like the removal of a bung from a cask of old wine.
Is it the echo from one of earth's haunted places,
Opened to let ghosts wander free?
The floor creaks insistently overhead.
Perhaps it is some spirit walking in the attic
To see if his childhood playthings are still there.
There is a wailing in the wind
Around the corner of the house,—
A wailing as of the crying of gulls,
Or the sighing of children who have been whipped and
sent to bed hungry.
Is this a sighing protest against being sent to the bed of
death,
When earth itself is so lovely?
What are these strange noises that cluster around an old
house at midnight?

AUTUMN'S COUNTRY
I
New England is autumn's country:
Spring is there, to be sure,
With lady's-slippers,
And trailing arbutus
As delicate as robins' twilight singing;
Winter, too, is there,
As hard and bleak as Stoic happiness;
Gay summer, with its wonder world of laurel,
And fragrance rising warm from meadow haystacks.
But autumn is the land's true season:
In autumn the boys from a thousand coast towns
Stand on the creek banks fishing for smelts
Whose amber scales to them are fairer
Than the golden nuggets of Alaskan mines.
In autumn the young men along the coast
And the middle aged men whom the season makes boys
Take from the racks above the kitchen doors
103

AUTUMN'S COUNTRY
Their well-oiled guns and put out before dawn
To the brown shining rocks where the gray coots are
feeding.
In autumn the big game hunters
Hear the call of the deep Maine woods,
The call of the bull moose snorting,
The frightened sniff of the graceful deer,
And the evanescent but enduring call
Of dappled sunlight under nut brown trees
Around a camp-fire before twilight at supper time,
With the curling smoke of the briar,
And the luxury of bodily weariness
Promising unbroken sleep.
The purple haze above her golden treetops
Is deep as the blue of her fringed gentians,
Her delicate hardwood leaves are red like wine,
Or bronze, like her burnt-orange sunrises,
Or brown like her newly made cider,
Or green-gold, like October sunsets,
Or streaked with a crimson and yellow
Like the cut of a brilliant pomegranate.
The rustle of falling maple leaves
Strikes my ear like the rustle of silks

AUTUMN'S COUNTRY
At the smiling approach of a woman
Whose comeliness silvers a household;
And the tapestries over the lawns,
With the pungent aroma that rises
From fires all over the village,
Lead my fancy away to the colors,
Burnt incense, and watch fires of Homer.
LEALY
II
Deeper still, autumn is the spirit's true mood in New
England.
It appears in the souls looking out from the eyes
Through lids piped about with brown pigment,
Of her most patrician women,
Smiling decorously
As they pass in their broughams and twin sixes
The brown stones of Commonwealth Avenue,
Or read the Atlantic's prim pages
As devoutly as ever their fathers
Perused the great psalms of the Bible.
It appears in the crisp, shielded lives
Of her straightforward, neatly-toned daughters
Whose manner has the charm of a squirrel

AUTUMN'S COUNTRY
Gracefully sitting on a gray rail fence,
With brown paws uplifted together;
And whose apprehensive glances
Are as startled as partridges
Beating brown wings through a thicket
At the stealthy approach of a hunter.
It appears in the speech of her circumspect young men
Whose voices visit my ear
Like the brooks of her mountain streams singing:
Harvesting crops of their fathers,
And reaching maturity late,
Like the flowers of northern New England.
Clearest of all it appears
In her old men hardy and brown,
Like her lawns keeping green through November,
When the year's twilight surrenders its leaves,
And the boughs on the sky-tinted water,
In an atmosphere blue as the ocean,
Have the crispness of delicate etchings.

Gray were the souls of the Mayflower Pilgrims
Who grimly set foot on the gray beach at Plymouth;

AUTUMN'S COUNTRY
But the Promised-Land-light in their rough, tawny faces
Mingled the gray with mosaics of gold.
Their sortie on earth was a long, gray tunnel
With a gleam of light at the heavenly end.
An autumn leaf dignity mellowed their language,
And mellowed the speech of their serious followers,
Scattered over a rocky soil,
Coloring a nation's earliest heritage.
The harvest moon spirit that hangs above autumn
Breathes from the world-famous message of Stoughton,
That our sires were wheat in the chaff of the nations
Sifted by heaven for grain of this wilderness.
Crisp as a last leaf the tribute to Cotton,
Stirring our hearts through the wind of the years:
"His daily conversation was a trembling walk with
God."
The towering soul of stout Jonathan Edwards,
Born to the stature of Dante or Milton,
Lapses from spring, the true season of poets,
And shrinks in the blight of autumnal New England:
"I walked abroad alone
In a solitary place in my father's pasture,

## p. 108 (#122) ############################################

AUTUMN'S COUNTRY
And as I was walking there
And looking upon the sky and clouds
There came into my mind So sweet a sense
Of the glorious majesty and grace of God
That I know not how to express;
A calm sweet abstraction of soul
From all the concerns of the world;
And sometimes a kind of vision
Of being alone in the mountains,
Or some solitary wilderness,
Far from all mankind,
Sweetly conversing with Christ,
And wrapt and swallowed up in God."
IV
Or turn to the summer-ripe best of New England
And sniff even there the cool musk air of autumn
Like twilight cool winds in the mid heart of day.
Climb the fresh trails alluring to Emerson
As he bade good-by to the lowland and plain,
Leaving regretfully haunting cathedrals,
Gloomily aisled, dimly monastic;
108


## p. 109 (#123) ############################################

AUTUMN'S COUNTRY
At rest in the shade of a tree on Monadnock
Reading the mystical pages of Swedenborg,
Till darkness and evening star clustered around him;
Down from the mount with long paces through under-
brush
He strode like an afterglow flame on red maples,
And standing in the torrent of Civil War rages
Uttered his passionless message to men.
Or walk the gray streets of old Salem with Hawthorne,
Mists of November close clinging about him,
Tinted the flowers of his pen the pale colors
That blossom apart in retired dark shades;
Coolness of feeling and deep meditation
Take the warm passion of spring from his pages,
And leave an aroma of twilight autumnal
That haunts us like Pearl in the depth of the forest.
Autumn severity creeps through the pages
Of Henry Thoreau, the exquisite doubter;
Barren of foliage his slim, graceful branches,
Nakedly brilliant their shadow-green bark
Against the frosty pink air of late autumn twilights.

AUTUMN'S COUNTRY
Fall-like are the slaty gray roofs
Of the long rambling buildings abandoned
Through the hills of our later New England.
The well sweeps and rain-gray stone walls
Look lone and deserted as spinsters
Whose brothers are ranching in Texas
Or shooting the rapids of Wall Street,
While they, in Colonial houses,
Look long from their many-paned windows
And vainly cry out for romance.
Young men who wistfully dream of adventure
Far from the noise of the loom or the spindle,
Fitfully pass ineffectual days
Enjoying the sun on these warm southern windows.
The fall spirit over these coast towns,
As thick as the myriad leaves
At the foot of her oaks or red maples,
Stirs with a mood as much different from summer's
As the sigh of the wind in November branches
From the rippling of zephyrs through leaves of July.
Men return, cat-like, again to these harbors

AUTUMN'S COUNTRY
To be crooned to in age by the voice of the sea;
And the kelps and the rockweed, the old mother's jewels,
Though tinted four seasons an iodine brown,
Only reach to the height of their crystalline luster
When the October sun sluices off the gold nuggets
Of a thousand red cliffs in a clean-up of beauty.
Dismantled schooners with rusty red anchors
And rusty red chains, repose on the mud flats,
Waiting for sailors, as New England mothers
Await the return of their sons from the West.
VI
Land of waving golden rod and lovely russet apples,
With little cedars on your slopes and driftwood on your
shores;
Land of blue-fringed gentians and a million purple
asters,
Land of bright red astrakhans and spice-brown groves of
spruce,
Lovelier in age than in the vigor of your springtime.-
Land of quiet tragedies and quiet brave repressions,
I know the light upon your face that only soul can bring;
And though you straggle far behind your zealous West-
ern brothers,

Whose steps are firm, whose voices stout, whose plunging
ventures carry
Success in every plunge and push a pathway to the
stars,-
For mine the fiber of your soul when facing life's
illusions,
For mine the mood within your heart at noonday of
Thanksgivings,
For mine your handsome, neat old age, the grandeur of
your spirit,
That has matched your matchless autumn with an
Indian Summer soul.
